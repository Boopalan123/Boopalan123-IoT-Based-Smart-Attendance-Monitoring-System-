This project presents a smart biometric attendance monitoring system that integrates an ESP32 microcontroller with a fingerprint sensor, LCD display, and a web page. The system is designed to provide a secure, reliable, and user-friendly solution for real-time attendance tracking. By leveraging fingerprint biometrics, the system ensures accurate identification and eliminates the possibility of proxy attendance. The LCD module offers instant visual feedback for each authentication attempt, enhancing the overall usability for end-users in institutional and organizational environments. The ESP32 connects to a ESP32-based server over Wi-Fi to manage fingerprint enrollment, authentication, and deletion, while storing attendance records in a SPIFFS database for centralized access and monitoring. This architecture enables seamless integration with existing IT infrastructure and facilitates remote access to attendance data via a web interface. The solution emphasizes  implementation, scalability, and minimal maintenance, making it ideal for deployment in schools, colleges, offices, and secure facilities aiming to modernize their attendance systems.
